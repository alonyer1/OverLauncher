Written in C++.

## Setup (REQUIRED)

### Through GUI
Launch OverGUI.exe, and click on "Redirect Domains". Select "Ok".

### Manually
In order for this to work, you need to point the domain `bnet-emu.fish` to `127.0.0.1`.
1. Open Notepad or any text editor with ADMINISTRATOR.
2. Head to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` and open the file.
3. Add `127.0.0.1 bnet-emu.fish` to the file.
4. Add `127.0.0.1 us.game.bwattle.uwu` to the file.
5. Click save.

(This won't mess with your computer in any way.)

## Usage

###Through GUI
Launch OverGUI.exe, and click on "Patch&Launch". It will open a dialogue to select the game client. Select your local GameClientApp.exe and click "open".

### Through Command Line
`OverLauncher "path in quotes"`
(You need quotes or it will not load, blame how strings work in c++ than me please)

Example: `OverLauncher.exe "D:\t\Overwatch 1\Overwatch Beta 0.8.0.24919\GameClientApp.exe"`

### Note
This is like really bad so I would 100% advise someone else to make a 3rd party launcher just using the patcher code.
